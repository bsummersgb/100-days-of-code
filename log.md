# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Let's do this!

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Forked the repo for #100DaysOfCode, compressed some jpegs, implemented a dynamic background image that changes based on the user's local weather, and used a case statement and some Sass.

**Thoughts:** Great first day that started off getting reacquainted with forking a Git repo. I also used a mixin for the dynamic background which was particularly satisfying as I'm finally applying concepts learned in tutorials into my own projects. Not sure how to link to a live preview of my work on GitHub yet but I'll figure that out tomorrow. Woohoo!


### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Implemented some styling to the app (I am no designer!). Used some flexbox. Also implemented a celcius to farenheit function for the temperature. Now to figure out how to toggle it back to celcius.

**Thoughts:** It's hard to work on a weather app with today's weather being so hot! Started later in the day and I found it difficult to get going. However, I successfully managed to achieve my mini goal of converting the temperature to farenheit. I should finish this off tomorrow.

### Day 3: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Made a function that toggles the temperature between the metric and imperial measurements. Learnt how to host the app on GitHub pages. Also saw the power of using global variables to store the ajax data.

**Thoughts:** I set my timer for an hour to figure out the functionality of the unit conversion and managed to do it in 40 minutes, with time to spare to set up a project page on GitHub. However, there is an issue with my background images not loading on the live demo. On first inspection, it seems to be a common issue but I'm yet to figure it out.

<!-- ### Day 2: January 4

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
